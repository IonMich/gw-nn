We reproduce the results of the study by H. Gabbard et al [Matching Matched Filtering with Deep Networks for Gravitational-Wave Astronomy](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.141103)

We generate the simulated data using Bilby and we build the neural network in Keras trying to match the architecture chosen in the [cnn-matchedfiltering](https://github.com/hagabbar/cnn_matchfiltering/blob/master/CNN-keras.py) repository.
